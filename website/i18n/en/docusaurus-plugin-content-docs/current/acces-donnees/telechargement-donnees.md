Molecular data files can currently be downloaded individually from the [CQDG portal](https://portail.cqdg.ca). However, due to their size, downloading sequencing files can take a long time. 

In order to facilitate data access, the CQDG will soon set-up high-speed tools allowing the simultaneous download of bulk files as well as a cloud computing environment allowing researchers to perform their analyzes without having to download the files.
