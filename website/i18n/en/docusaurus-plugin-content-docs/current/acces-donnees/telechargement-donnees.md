Files can currently be downloaded individually from the [CQDG portal](https://plateforme.cqdg.ca). However, due to their size, downloading sequencing files can take a long time. In order to facilitate data access, the CQDG will soon set-up high-speed tools allowing the simultaneous download of bulk files as well as a cloud computing environment allowing researchers to perform their analyzes of CQDG data without have to download them.
