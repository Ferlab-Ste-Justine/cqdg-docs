> The CQDG team is developing a submission system for online validation of your data. In the meantime, please follow the procedure described in this guide.



## How to Submit your Clinical Data

Before beginning the procedure for submitting your data, please [contact us](https://portail.cqdg.ca/contact) to tell us about your needs regarding the storage and sharing of your data. Please note that clinical data must be submitted following the data model described in the [data dictionary](https://docs.cqdg.ca/dictionnaire/). We recommend that you review the latest version of the data dictionary to familiarize yourself with the specific formats and restrictions for each data field before beginning the submission process.

### Step 1: Download a SFTP Client

[Contact-us](https://portail.cqdg.ca/contact) to create your SFTP account allowing you to securely transfer your data. 

### Step 2: Register your Samples

1. Log in to your account on the Portal's homepage. 
2. Download the **File Templates** that can be found the [Data Dictionary page](https://docs.cqdg.ca/en/dictionnaire/).
3. Open the **sample_registration.tsv** template with Excel to enter information about the samples you wish to register with the CQDG. 
3. Name your file staring with _registration_ and save it in a .tsv format.  


### Step 3: Submit your Clinical Data

1. From the **File Templates** folder, open .tsv files for which you would like to submit data by using Excel.
2. Copy your data in TEXT format in the appropriate fields (field names are indicated in the first row). There is one template for each table of the Data Dictionary. You do not have to complete all of these templates in order to submit data the CQDG.
3. Name your files starting with the name of the Clinical Data Table (e.g. _donor_, _biospecimen_, etc.) and save them in .tsv format.
4. Upload your files (including your _registration_ file) using your SFTP account.

## How to Submit your Molecular Data

> Please note that the tools for submitting molecular data are under development. [Contact us](https://portail.cqdg.ca/contact) to plan the transfer of your molecular data to the CQDG.


## Processing of Submitted Molecular Data

Once your molecular data has been submitted, it will be analyzed using uniform pipelines for all samples.


## Quality Control and Data Release


The data will not be made public until the quality control process is complete.

> Please note that an embargo period may be required, during which only study researchers can access the data. After this embargo period, the data can be made accessible to researchers not affiliated with the study.
